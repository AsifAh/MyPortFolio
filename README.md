From legacy systems to advanced AI/ML solutions, my journey has been fueled by curiosity. Actively engaging with the technology landscape, I not only comprehend business applications but also conduct rigorous data analysis. Seamless collaboration with stakeholders and the execution of technology deployments are integral aspects of my approach.

My passion lies in crafting robust Data Strategies for businesses to harness their full potential. This encompasses everything from formulating storage strategies to delving into data engineering, and facilitating on-demand analytics and AI applications.
