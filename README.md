## Meet Me
### This Section is to introduce myself


Hello! My name is Syed, and I hail from the vibrant city of Chennai, located in the southern part of India near the sea shore of Bay of Bengal. My journey with technology began when Windows XP was launched. I quickly became the go-to expert in my neighborhood for installing operating systems and software (NO, not the cracked ones in CD-ROM, ðŸ˜‰). This early fascination with computers laid the foundation for my future career.

In school, I delved into Oracle RDBMS and Visual Basics, which ignited my passion for database management and programming. My engineering studies expanded my knowledge base further, covering data structures, object-oriented programming, database management systems, and computer networks.

After completing my education, I joined the IT consulting workforce in India, working for Fortune 500 companies. Over the years, I've climbed the ranks from a developer to a team lead, tester, package engineer, business analyst, and, ultimately, a technical architect. The best part of working with consulting firms is the opportunity to work on diverse client systems and technologies. I've gained hands-on experience with legacy systems like Mainframes, RDBMS such as DB2, MSSQL, Postgres, and AWS Redshift, ETL tools like Informatica, BI tools like Tibco, Power BI, Qlik Sense, scripting languages such as SQL and Python 3.x, schedulers like Control-M, data science packages like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Plotly, and Bokeh, and big data technologies such as Hadoop, Spark, and Databricks. Additionally, I've worked extensively with cloud infrastructure, including Azure Data Factory, Azure Blob Storage, and Azure Data Lake.

Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with clients across various domains, including capital markets, BFSI, printing tech, manufacturing, and healthcare. This diverse experience has taken me to different geographies, from India to Africa, with a significant portion of my clients based in North America.

To further enhance my expertise, I've earned several prestigious certifications, including Senior Data Scientist from the Data Science Council of America, AHIP - Professional Healthcare Associate Professional, and recently, CDMP - Certified Data Management Professional from DAMA.

The COVID period was an inflection point in my technical career. I witnessed the rapid digital transformation that businesses were undergoing and recognized a growing void in technical leadership. Seizing this opportunity, I decided to take a break from my flourishing career to pursue an MBA in a north American B School where my knowledge was more relevant. This journey is part of my aspiration to become the natural technology leader that modern businesses need. My Current interest are in AI , Automation , Data Democratization , interoperability , and hypercloud.

Thank you for visiting my website. I look forward to connecting and exploring opportunities to innovate and lead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
